## Integrating Google Maps
Deliverables:
1. Create a php site that takes and address or has clickable address and redirects to google map site.
- site can be a single page
- must have a redirect link

2. Maybe take subset of sql db of Roseville addresses and make all clickable to target on a page. (Load database onto page.)
